# Sephora Price Prediction ModelðŸ’¡

As an avid beauty lover, I am interested in uncovering the underlying factors that influence the pricing of beauty items, ranging from brand names, ratings, and beauty category. This could predict actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction and pricing structures for beauty products on Sephora's platform. 

As a result, I developed a function, predict_price(rating, primary_category, brand_name), for predicting product prices based on the selected variables. The function incorporates the trained model's coefficients and utilizes the provided input values for rating, primary category, and brand name.

Key Skills Used: Feature Engineering/Selection with Dummy Variables, Hypothesis Testing with Permutations, Train/test set, Residuals, Multicollinearity, Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV, Multi-Linear Regression Model, K-Fold Cross Validation, RMSE, and Predictive Modeling Function.
